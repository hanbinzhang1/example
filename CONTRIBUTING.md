Provide more context by answering these questions:

Can you reproduce the problem in safe mode?
Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of Atom) or was this always a problem?
If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Atom? What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Atom from the releases page.
Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some? Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?
